# Home Assistant Community Add-on: wmbusmeters (W-Mbus to MQTT)

Allows you to acquire utility meter readings **without** the vendors bridge or gateway as long as they support C1, T1 or S1 telegrams using the wireless mbus protocol (WMBUS).

It bridges WMBUS readings via MQTT. In this way you can integrate with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.

See Documentation tab for more details.
